# SI Finder - Installation Guide (Linux)

Welcome to SI Finder! This is a "Setup-once" portable application.

## How to Install

1. **Extract** this ZIP file.
2. **Double-click** the `SI-Finder` binary (or run `./SI-Finder` in a terminal).
3. **Setup Logic**: The first time you run it, the app will automatically:
   - Copy itself to your system (`~/.local/share/SI-Finder/`).
   - Create a shortcut in your **Applications Menu**.
4. **Clean Up**: Once you see the "Installation Successful" message, you can safely **delete this extraction folder**.

## Launching Later

After completion, you don't need this folder anymore. Simply search for **"SI Finder"** in your Activities/Show Applications menu to launch it.
